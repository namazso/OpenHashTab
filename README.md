## About

OpenHashTab is a shell extension for conveniently calculating and checking file hashes from file properties.

## Features

* Support for 22 algorithms, see **Algorithms**
* High performance hash calculation
* Native Windows looks
* High DPI screen support
* Long path support\*
* Multilingual (Consider contributing to translation!)
* Check hashes against VirusTotal with a button
* Hash checking against a checksum file (Supported: hex hash next to file, \*sum output (hex or base64), corz .hash, SFV)
* Hash export to file or clipboard (Supported: \*sum output, corz .hash, SFV)
* Optional context menu option for faster access
* File associations and standalone mode

\* to the extent Windows and configuration supports it. [Enable long paths](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/51704-enable-disable-win32-long-paths-windows-10-a.html) on 1607+ for better support.

## System requirements

* Windows Vista or later (x86 / x64 / ARM64)
* 1 GB RAM or more (for efficent hashing of more than 512 files at a time)

## Usage

Most of the actions should be obvious. Some not-so-obvious features are listed here:

* You can select multiple files or folders, all files will be hashed, directories traversed
* Double click hash to copy it
* Double click name or algorithm to copy the line in sumfile format
* Right click for popup menu: copy hash, copy filename, copy line, copy everything
* The counters next to the status text is in the format `(match/mismatch/nothing to check against/error)`
* Columns sort lexographically, except the hash column which sorts by match type
* Selecting the tab on a sumfile will interpret it as such and hash the files listed in it.
* If a hashed file has a sumfile with same filename plus one of the recognized sumfile extensions and the option for it is enabled, the file hash is checked against it.

## Algorithms

* CRC32
* xxHash (XXH32, XXH64)
* xxHash3 (64 and 128 bit variants)
* MD4, MD5
* RipeMD160
* Blake2sp
* SHA-1
* SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
* SHA-3 (SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512)
* BLAKE3
* KangarooTwelve (264 bit)
* ParallelHash128 (264 bit) and ParallelHash256 (528 bit)
* Streebog (GOST R 34.11-12)
